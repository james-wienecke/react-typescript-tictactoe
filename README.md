# React Tic-tac-toe (in TypeScript)

A fun little side project to continue developing my front-end skills and learn some new things.
This project was made following along with this [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html),
but is implemented with React functional components and hooks instead of class components.
Also, it's written in TypeScript.
